Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

Here are some common scenarios where you might want to use the builder pattern:

1. Complex object creation: If you have a complex object that requires many parameters or configurations to be set, using a constructor with many parameters can become unwieldy and error-prone. The Builder pattern provides a more flexible way to create the object by allowing you to set the parameters and configurations separately.

2. Immutable objects: If you have an immutable object, you cannot modify its properties after it has been created. Using a Builder pattern can allow you to create the object with all its properties set, and then return the immutable object once it has been fully constructed.

3. Variations of objects: If you need to create variations of a particular object, such as different types of pizzas or cars, the Builder pattern can be used to provide a flexible way to create these variations by configuring the different options and parameters.

4. Test data creation: If you need to create test data for your application, the Builder pattern can be used to create test objects with various configurations and parameters.

It's important to note that the Builder pattern can add complexity to your code, so it's important to carefully consider whether it's appropriate for your use case. It's also worth noting that other patterns, such as the Factory pattern, may be more appropriate for certain scenarios.

- Use the Builder pattern to get rid of a “telescoping constructor”.
- Use the Builder pattern when you want your code to be able to create different representations of some product (for example, stone and wooden houses).
- Use the Builder to construct Composite trees or other complex objects.

Conceptual Example
The Builder pattern is used when the desired product is complex and requires multiple steps to complete. In this case, several construction methods would be simpler than a single monstrous constructor. The potential problem with the multistage building process is that a partially built and unstable product may be exposed to the client. The Builder pattern keeps the product private until it’s fully built.

In the below code, we see different types of houses (igloo and normalHouse) being constructed by iglooBuilder and normalBuilder. Each house type has the same construction steps. The optional director struct helps to organize the building process.
