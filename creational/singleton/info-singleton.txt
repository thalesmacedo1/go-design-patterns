Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

Here are some common scenarios where you might want to use the singleton pattern:

1. Resource management: If you have a limited resource (such as a database connection or a thread pool), you can use the singleton pattern to ensure that only one instance of the resource is created and shared among multiple parts of your program.

2. Configuration settings: If you have global configuration settings that need to be accessed from different parts of your program, you can use a singleton to ensure that all parts of the program are using the same instance of the configuration object.

3. Logging: If you have a logging class that you want to use throughout your program, you can use a singleton to ensure that all parts of the program are logging to the same file or database.

4. Caching: If you have a cache that needs to be shared among different parts of your program, you can use a singleton to ensure that there is only one instance of the cache and that all parts of the program are accessing the same cache.
