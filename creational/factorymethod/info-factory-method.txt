Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

Here are some common scenarios where you might want to use the factory method pattern:

1. Object creation with dependencies: If creating an object requires other objects or resources to be initialized, the Factory Method pattern can be used to abstract away the details of the initialization process and provide a clean interface for creating objects.

2. Object creation based on configuration: If the type of object to be created is determined by configuration settings or other runtime factors, the Factory Method pattern can provide a way to create the object without requiring you to write conditional logic or switch statements.

3. Object creation with extensibility: If you need to add new types of objects to your application in the future, the Factory Method pattern can provide a way to add new subclasses without modifying existing code.

4. Object creation with localization: If you need to create objects that are localized to different languages or regions, the Factory Method pattern can provide a way to create objects with the appropriate language or region settings without requiring you to write separate code for each language or region.

Use the Factory Method when you want to provide users of your library or framework with a way to extend its internal components.
Use the Factory Method when you want to save system resources by reusing existing objects instead of rebuilding them each time.
